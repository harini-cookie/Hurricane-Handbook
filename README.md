# Hurricane-Handbook
Great Hurricane of 1780 stole many lives and left the economy in vein. This mobile application focuses on acting as a guide book of safety and rescuing lives by providing advice and stages of preparation. 

## Inspiration
My inspiration towards this app was the fact that millions of lives were lost unnecessarily before advanced technology existed to guide individuals. I wanted to build this app that could have potentially changed the past event. KNOWLEDGE is the key to success and living a peaceful life as it provides a hand in most situations. In this catastrophic storm, people didn't plan ahead and struggled to survive. If technology was more advanced back then, it would have acted as a pillar for their future. 

## What it does
This mobile application provides information and stages of hurricane evacuation. The home page contains the entire process which consists of preparing materials, sealing your home, planning evacuation, abandoning home, and staying safe at shelter. 

## How I built it
I built the application "Hurricane Handbook" using react native framework. I programmed in JavaScript using Visual Studio Code and simulated my results on Expo Client. 

## Challenges I ran into
I was challenged by the mapView feature of react-native. I wanted to use MapBox which provides colorful themes and 3D-structures displayed by the coordinate markers. However, it was extremely difficult to incorporate the MapBox feature on Expo. Therefore, I had to end up utilising mapView.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I carry the pride of obtaining trustworthy information about how to safely evacuate before and during the hurricane. I was also able to design the buttons and other features aesthetically on my application.

## What I learned
I have created a couple of apps using react-native in the past. This is my first successful and working app that had allowed me to obtain in-depth analysis on how to build good apps to suffice user's needs.

## What's next for Hurricane Handbook
Due to time constraint in hackathon, I wasn't able to expand my vision on the last minute stage. Giving hope and plenty of choices for the user during this rare stage will be an eye-opener to increasing amount of survivals and expansion of app's popularity. 

## Construction Time
This app was built from July 31 to August 3. I mostly worked on it during midnight. This is built specifically for the BYTEHACKS 2020.
